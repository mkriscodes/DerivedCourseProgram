# CourseProgram
I created a base class called "Course" that has a base member called "CourseId" and a calcFinalGrade() method.
Then I created a mathClass and a computerScienceClass that are dervied from the base class and have their own courseId. 
Each derived class overrides the calcFinalGrade() method and displays the courseId and the final grade for each class.
